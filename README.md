Generate, tailor and manage Vim color schemes

# Introduction

At the current time, this repository only hold all of the Vim
color schemes I was able to download from the www.vim.org
site using the 
[downloadVimColorSchemes.sh script](https://github.com/megaannum/vim_color_schemes_downloader).

It is my intension to generate a VimL script that will allow the
user to generate, tailor and manage their color scheme files.

For now, I am just using the repository to save the downloaded 
color scheme files.
