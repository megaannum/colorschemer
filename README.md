# colorschemer

Generate, tailor and manage Vim color schemes

# Introduction

At the current time, this repository only hold all of the Vim
color schemes I was able to download from the www.vim.org
site using the 
[downloadVimColorSchemes.sh script](https://github.com/megaannum/vim_color_schemes_downloader).

It is my intension to generate a VimL script that will allow the
user to generate, tailor and manage their color scheme files.

For now, I am just using the repository to save the downloaded 
color scheme files.

# Installation

## Download

Not installed at www.vim.org yet.

## Dependency

Forms depends upon the Self Libaray, a prototype-based object system:
[VIM](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3072)
or 
[GitHup]( https://github.com/megaannum/self)
and on the Forms library at
[VIM](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4150)
or
[GitHup]( https://github.com/megaannum/forms)

## Directory layout

After unpacking the ColorSchemer directory layout should look like:

    $HOME/.vim/
      autoload/
        colorschemer/
          distill.vim  
            " generate distilled color scheme files 
          util.vim  
          viewer.vim
            " view test files with their syntax allowing for
            " very quick toggling through color schemes
      data/
        " data that persists between invocations of a plugin
        colorschemer/
            " colorschemer data 
            colors/  
              " source Vim color scheme files (some 688 of them!)
            distilled/  
              " target directory for files generated by distill.vim
            distilled.cterm/  
              " generated using distill.vim in Vim
            distilled.gui/  
              " generated using distill.vim in GVim
            test/  
              " test source files (c, pl, java, scala, tex, html)
              " users can add addition ones


## Intalling with vim-addon-manager (VAM)

For more information about vim-addon-manager, see [vim-addon-manager](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager) and [Vim-addon-manager getting started](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager/blob/master/doc/vim-addon-manager-getting-started.txt)

In your .vimrc, add self as shown below:

    fun SetupVAM()

      ...

      let g:vim_addon_manager = {}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources = {}

      ....

      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['self'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/self'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['forms'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/forms'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['colorschemer'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/colorschemer'}


      let plugins = [
        \ 'self',
        \ 'forms',
        \ 'colorschemer'
        \ ]

      call vam#ActivateAddons(plugins,{'auto_install' : 0})

      ...

    endf
    call SetupVAM()


Now start Vim. You will be asked by vim-addon-manager 
if you would like to download and install the self plugin (no dependencies).

## Installing with pathogen

I do not use pathogen. An example usage would be welcome.

# Supported Platforms

Ought to work where ever Forms works.

## Tutorial
